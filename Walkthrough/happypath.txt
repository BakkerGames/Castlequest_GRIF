// This is the Castlequest "Happy Path" script to get the 300-point ending.
// It works as is for the IFE version and it works with adjustments for the
// 1981 Fortran version.
//
// In the 1981 version, as long as you watch for random wolf and gnome
// appearances and handle them (and don't die from them), it will work to
// complete the game. Save often! The one encounter with the Mirror Maze in
// the 1981 version requires repeating directions until you exit, however
// long that takes. In the IFE version, it will only take one move due to
// modifed logic.
//
// This is not guaranteed to be the shortest path. I didn't try to make it
// that tight, and only used it to verify the files and the IFE program.
// The number of moves will be different in IFE than in the 1981 version,
// which counted LOOK as a move and other issues. IFE counts a move each
// time a command is entered and something actually happens. The lamp fuel
// has been adjusted in order to line up better with the 1981 version.
